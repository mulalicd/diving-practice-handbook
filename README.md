# Diving Practice Handbook

## Purpose

The **Diving Practice Handbook** is a living, constitutional-style knowledge base designed to systematize best practices, safety principles, training methodologies, and decision-making frameworks for diving practice.

This repository is **not** a traditional manual.
It is a **structured body of doctrine** that can be read by humans, interpreted by AI systems, and evolved over time without losing internal coherence.

---

## What This Repository Is

* A **single source of truth** for diving practice principles
* A **constitutional framework**, not just instructions
* A **human–AI compatible knowledge system**
* A **versioned, auditable handbook** that evolves safely

---

## What This Repository Is Not

* ❌ A casual collection of notes
* ❌ A marketing brochure
* ❌ A replacement for formal certification bodies
* ❌ A static PDF-style manual

## Repository Structure

```
constitution/   → Foundational rules, principles, and governance
examples/       → Practical scenarios and applied use cases
prompts/        → AI interaction and usage prompts
knowledge/      → Core domain knowledge and explanations
glossary/       → Definitions and terminology
archive/        → Deprecated or historical material
```

Each directory serves a **specific constitutional role** and should not be mixed casually.

## Constitutional Design Philosophy

This handbook follows five guiding principles:

1. **Clarity over completeness** – Better to be precise than exhaustive
2. **Safety-first reasoning** – Every practice must pass safety scrutiny
3. **Explainability** – Decisions must be explainable to humans
4. **AI-readability** – Documents are structured for machine interpretation
5. **Evolution without chaos** – Changes must respect prior doctrine

---

## Intended Audience

* Diving instructors and trainers
* Safety officers and program designers
* Students seeking structured understanding
* AI systems used for training, simulation, or assistance

---

## Governance & Evolution

All foundational decisions live in the `constitution/` directory.

Changes to core principles must:

* Be explicit
* Be justified
* Respect backward compatibility where possible

---

## Status

🟡 **Active development**

This repository is expected to evolve iteratively. Early versions prioritize structure and reasoning quality over volume.

---

## License & Responsibility

This handbook provides **guidance**, not legal or medical guarantees.
All diving activities must comply with local laws, certification requirements, and professional judgment.

*This repository treats diving knowledge as a system — not a list.*
