## Key Principles
1. **Strict adherence to content** — web app must reflect the exact structure and content from this repository.  
2. **Human-like presentation** — text, examples, and instructions must read naturally as if written by a professional instructor.  
3. **Interactivity and functionality** — all examples, diagrams, and calculators must work as intended.  
4. **Security and compliance** — GDPR and safety rules are mandatory.  
5. **Version control** — any updates must be documented in `11-appendices/update-history.md`.
