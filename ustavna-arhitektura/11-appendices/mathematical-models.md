# Mathematical Models in Diving

Diving involves precise calculations to manage safety and decompression.

## Key Models
- **Nitrogen Loading**: Depth × Time × Tissue Saturation  
- **Oxygen Toxicity**: Partial pressure thresholds  
- **Decompression Stops**: Based on dive profiles and tables  

## Implementation Tips
- Cross-check results with dive computers  
- Use models to plan conservative ascent profiles  
- Keep calculations simple and transparent for beginners  

## Key Takeaways
Mathematical models enhance safety by quantifying risk and guiding dive planning.
