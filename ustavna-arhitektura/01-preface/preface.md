# Preface

Diving is often presented as an accessible recreational activity, yet its inherent risks demand discipline, knowledge, and constant self-reflection.  

This Handbook was created to provide divers with a structured, principled approach to SCUBA practice, combining modern technology with time-tested knowledge.  
While dive computers have replaced manual tables for many, understanding the underlying mechanics, physics, and planning remains essential for safety and skill mastery.  

Readers are encouraged to engage actively with the material, try interactive examples, and reflect on each dive.  
The Handbook is not merely a guide but a companion for lifelong learning in diving.
