# Intent and Scope

This handbook is designed for divers of all levels who seek a deeper understanding of SCUBA diving beyond commercialized instruction. It integrates professional standards from SSI, CMAS, and other recognized diving associations, while providing additional insights from real-world experience.

The intent of this handbook is to:

- Provide divers with a solid foundation of diving philosophy, ethics, and safety.
- Reinforce self-awareness, self-control, and reflective practices after each dive.
- Introduce forgotten or overlooked fundamentals such as dive tables, gas physics, and manual planning techniques.
- Offer interactive exercises, practical scenarios, and tools to strengthen decision-making under real conditions.
- Prepare readers for safe, responsible, and enjoyable diving experiences, with a focus on long-term diver development.

This handbook is not a replacement for formal certification courses. It is an **enhancement**, bridging gaps in knowledge that often appear in traditional programs.
