# Reader Prerequisites

Before engaging fully with this Handbook, readers should have:  

1. Basic SCUBA certification (Open Water Diver or equivalent).  
2. Familiarity with diving terminology (see Glossary).  
3. Basic understanding of dive planning and the use of dive computers.  
4. Willingness to engage in self-reflection, planning, and post-dive analysis.  

No prior advanced knowledge is required, but a curious, disciplined, and ethical mindset is essential.  
The Handbook is designed to scale with the reader: beginners will learn foundations, while advanced divers can deepen their knowledge of risk management, team dynamics, and environmental awareness.
