# Altitude and Lake Diving

Diving at altitude or in lakes introduces unique physiological challenges.

## Key Concepts
- Reduced atmospheric pressure affects decompression calculations  
- Cold water temperatures increase risk of hypothermia  
- Limited visibility and confined spaces require enhanced situational awareness  

## Altitude Diving Procedures
1. Use altitude-adjusted dive tables or computer settings  
2. Increase surface intervals to compensate for nitrogen loading  
3. Monitor ascent rate carefully  

## Lake-Specific Considerations
- Freshwater buoyancy differs from seawater  
- Sudden thermoclines may affect buoyancy control  
- Plan navigation carefully in low-visibility conditions  

## Key Takeaways
Altitude and lake diving demand careful planning and respect for local conditions.
