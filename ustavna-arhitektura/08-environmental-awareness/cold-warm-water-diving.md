# Cold and Warm Water Diving

Temperature impacts diver physiology, equipment choice, and dive planning.

## Physiological Effects
- Cold water: increased gas consumption, risk of hypothermia  
- Warm water: risk of dehydration and overheating in surface prep  

## Equipment Adjustments
- Insulation: wetsuit, drysuit, hoods, gloves  
- Thermal protection for regulators if diving in cold water  

## Safety Tips
- Monitor physical condition continuously  
- Adjust dive profiles for thermal stress  
- Always carry surface signaling devices  

## Key Takeaways
Water temperature influences every aspect of the dive. Proper preparation prevents accidents.
