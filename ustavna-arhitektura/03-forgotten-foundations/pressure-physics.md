# Pressure and Physics

- How pressure changes with depth and its effect on air volume, buoyancy, and body physiology.  
- Practical examples: calculating ascent rates, avoiding barotrauma, and understanding air consumption.  
- Real-life scenarios where physics knowledge prevents common mistakes.
