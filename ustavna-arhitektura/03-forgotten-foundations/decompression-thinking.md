# Decompression Thinking

Dive computers are useful, but understanding decompression theory is essential:

- The role of nitrogen absorption and off-gassing.  
- Recognizing the limits of no-decompression dives.  
- Planning multi-level dives manually.  
- Risk factors and conservative approaches.

The goal is to cultivate a **mental model** of decompression, not just follow a screen.
