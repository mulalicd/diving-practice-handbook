# Ustavna Arhitektura (Constitutional Architecture)

## Overview

This directory contains the constitutional architecture of the Diving Practice Handbook—the core structured content organized according to foundational principles of clarity, safety, and systematic knowledge organization.

"Ustavna Arhitektura" translates to "Constitutional Architecture" in English, reflecting the handbook's approach of treating diving knowledge as a constitutional system with internal coherence, hierarchical structure, and controlled evolution.

---

## Purpose

This constitutional architecture serves three primary functions:

1. **Knowledge Organization**: Systematic structuring of diving practice knowledge into logical, interconnected chapters
2. **AI Readability**: Content formatted for both human comprehension and machine interpretation
3. **Version Control**: Stable foundation that can evolve while maintaining backward compatibility

## Directory Structure

The ustavna-arhitektura is organized into 12 core sections plus build instructions:

### Core Content Chapters (01-11)

```
00-metadata/                    → Reference materials and terminology
01-preface/                     → Introduction and reader preparation  
02-philosophy-of-diving-practice/ → Foundational mindset and ethics
03-forgotten-foundations/       → Core diving knowledge often overlooked
04-practical-diving-practice/   → Application of principles to real dives
05-safety-risk-and-errors/      → Risk management and human factors
06-gas-and-physiology/          → Breathing gases and body systems
07-equipment-and-configuration/ → Equipment philosophy and setup
08-environmental-awareness/     → Environmental conditions and adaptation
09-ethics-culture-and-commercialization/ → Professional responsibility
10-tools-not-rules/             → Decision frameworks and mental models
11-appendices/                  → Compliance, disclaimers, and technical appendices
```

### Supporting Infrastructure

```
build-instructions/             → Technical specifications for web app development
CONSTITUTION.md                → Master reference defining handbook structure
```

## Navigation Guide

### For First-Time Readers

**Start Here**:
1. Read `CONSTITUTION.md` to understand the master structure
2. Review `01-preface/` to assess your readiness
3. Begin with `02-philosophy-of-diving-practice/` to internalize core values
4. Progress through `03-forgotten-foundations/` for knowledge foundation

**Then Explore**:
- Chapters 04-08 based on your diving activities
- Chapter 09 if you're an instructor or professional
- Chapter 10 for decision-making tools
- Chapter 11 as reference when needed

### For Returning Users

**Quick Reference**:
- `00-metadata/` - Glossary, abbreviations, references
