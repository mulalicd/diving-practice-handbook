# Configuration Logic

Proper equipment configuration is crucial for safe and efficient diving.

## Key Principles
- Redundancy: Always carry backup systems for critical functions  
- Streamlining: Minimize drag and entanglement risks  
- Accessibility: Ensure all equipment is easy to reach and operate underwater  

## Configuration Types
- **Backmount**: Traditional cylinder placement on the back  
- **Side-mount**: Cylinders on the sides for technical or cave diving  
- **Rebreathers**: Closed or semi-closed systems for extended dive times  

## Checklist Approach
1. Inspect each item individually  
2. Verify interactions between components  
3. Perform buoyancy and trim check  

## Key Takeaways
A logical, standardized configuration improves safety and reduces stress during dives.
