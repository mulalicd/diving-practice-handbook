# Redundancy Thinking

Redundancy reduces the risk of catastrophic failure underwater.

## Examples of Redundancy
- Backup regulators and octopus  
- Dual gauges or dive computers  
- Redundant cutting tools for entanglement scenarios  

## Planning for Failure
- Anticipate possible equipment failures before each dive  
- Practice emergency procedures regularly  
- Understand priorities: breathe, ascend safely, manage buoyancy  

## Key Takeaways
Redundancy is not optional—it is a cornerstone of safe diving.
