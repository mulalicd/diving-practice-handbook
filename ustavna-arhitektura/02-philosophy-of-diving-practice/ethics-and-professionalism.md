# Ethics and Professionalism

A diver’s ethical responsibility extends beyond personal safety. It includes:

- **Environmental stewardship**: respecting marine life and ecosystems.  
- **Team accountability**: prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of dive buddies.  
- **Integrity**: adhering to recognized standards without cutting corners.  
- **Continuous learning**: regularly updating knowledge and skills.

Professionalism in diving also means **documenting and analyzing dives**, reporting incidents accurately, and mentoring others whenever possible.
