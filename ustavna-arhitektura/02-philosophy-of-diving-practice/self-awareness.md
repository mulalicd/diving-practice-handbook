# Self-Awareness

Self-awareness is the cornerstone of safe diving. Key components include:

- **Physical awareness**: monitoring air supply, buoyancy, and fatigue.  
- **Psychological awareness**: recognizing stress, anxiety, or overconfidence.  
- **Environmental awareness**: identifying currents, visibility changes, and potential hazards.

Maintaining self-awareness allows divers to **anticipate problems before they occur**, reducing the risk of incidents underwater.
