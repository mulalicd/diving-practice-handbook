# Self-Reflection

After every dive, take time to reflect:

- What went well?  
- What could be improved?  
- Were there moments of stress or confusion?  
- How did your decisions affect your buddy and the environment?  

Documenting reflections in a dive log or journal strengthens learning and **builds a culture of continuous improvement**, critical for long-term diver development.
