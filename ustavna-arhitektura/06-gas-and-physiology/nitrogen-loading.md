# Nitrogen Loading

Nitrogen accumulates in tissues during a dive and must be managed to prevent decompression sickness.

## Principles
- Deeper and longer dives increase nitrogen absorption.  
- Different tissues absorb and release nitrogen at different rates (fast vs. slow tissues).  

## Managing Nitrogen
- Follow dive tables or computer algorithms for depth and time.  
- Plan repetitive dives with appropriate surface intervals.  
- Ascend slowly to allow safe off-gassing.  

## Key Takeaways
Understanding nitrogen dynamics is critical for safe dive planning and post-dive recovery.
