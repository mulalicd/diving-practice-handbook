# Breathing Gases

Understanding breathing gases is essential for safe and effective diving.

## Common Gases
- **Air**: 21% Oxygen, 79% Nitrogen  
- **Nitrox (Enriched Air)**: Increased Oxygen, reduced Nitrogen  
- **Trimix**: Mixture of Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Helium for deep diving  
- **Heliox**: Helium and Oxygen, used in commercial or extreme depth diving  

## Effects Under Pressure
- **Nitrogen Narcosis**: Impaired judgment and motor skills at depth  
- **Oxygen Toxicity**: High partial pressures of Oxygen can lead to convulsions  
- **Helium Considerations**: Reduces narcosis but increases heat loss  

## Key Takeaways
Always calculate exposure limits and monitor depth and time to prevent gas-related injuries.
