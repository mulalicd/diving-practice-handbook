# Physiology Underwater

Diving affects multiple body systems that must be understood for safety.

## Circulatory System
- Increased ambient pressure affects blood flow and gas exchange  
- Immersion can lead to pooling of blood in the thorax  

## Respiratory System
- Breathing resistance increases with depth  
- Carbon dioxide buildup can occur if ventilation is inadequate  

## Nervous System
- Nitrogen narcosis can impair judgment and reflexes  
- Stress and cold can exacerbate physiological responses  

## Key Takeaways
Understanding how the body reacts underwater helps divers anticipate and manage risks.
