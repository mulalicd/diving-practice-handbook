# Oxygen Toxicity

Excessive partial pressures of oxygen can be dangerous underwater.

## Types
- **Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity**: Short-term high exposure leading to convulsions  
- **Pulmonary Toxicity**: Long-term moderate exposure causing lung irritation  

## Safety Guidelines
- Calculate partial pressures using the formula:  
  `PPO2 = Fraction of O2 × Ambient Pressure`  
- Keep CNS PPO2 below 1.4 bar during normal diving  
- Monitor exposure over multiple dives and plan accordingly  

## Key Takeaways
Oxygen is life-sustaining but requires careful management at depth.
