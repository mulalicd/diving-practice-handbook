# Rendering Rules

These rules define how content should appear and function in the web app.

## Layout & Navigation
- Display chapters in a sidebar or expandable menu  
- Maintain hierarchical structure as in GitHub  
- Support direct links to each section  

## Interactive Elements
- Render diagrams and tables as interactive elements where indicated  
- Support calculation models (e.g., nitrogen loading, decompression tables)  
- Allow exporting content sections or full chapters to PDF  

## User Experience
- Track reading progress automatically  
- Provide clear navigation for returning users  
- Preserve all formatting from Markdown  

## Key Takeaways
Rendering must be **faithful to repository structure**, functional, and user-friendly without altering core content.
