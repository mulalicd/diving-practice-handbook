# ACA Constraints

These constraints must be strictly followed by the AI Coding Assistant (ACA) when generating the web application.

## Core Rules
1. **Do not alter UI design** — any change to design may break the approved look.  
2. **Use only content from this repository** — no external content insertion.  
3. **Ensure all calculations are accurate** — all mathematical models and dive tables must match content in `ustavna-arhitektura`.  
4. **Security First** — all data storage and user interactions must be GDPR-compliant.  
5. **Preserve interactive examples** — all `.md` content with interactive examples must remain functional.  
6. **Human-like text only** — do not generate content that appears AI-written; use professional, human tone.  

## Key Takeaways
ACA must treat this repository as the **sole source of truth**. Any deviation from constraints invalidates the build.
