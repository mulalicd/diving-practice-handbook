# Risk Perception

Divers often underestimate or overestimate risk. Awareness is essential.

## Common Biases
- **Optimism bias**: Believing accidents happen only to others.  
- **Familiarity bias**: Assuming familiar locations or procedures are inherently safe.  
- **Overconfidence**: Ignoring personal limitations or environmental changes.  

## Improving Risk Perception
- Use checklists and planning models to evaluate objective risk.  
- Conduct team discussions to compare perspectives.  
- Practice scenario-based training to experience and anticipate hazards.  

## Key Takeaways
Accurate risk perception is the cornerstone of effective decision-making underwater.
