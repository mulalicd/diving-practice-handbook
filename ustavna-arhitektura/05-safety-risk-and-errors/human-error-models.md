# Human Error Models

Understanding human error is critical for preventing accidents in diving.

## Types of Errors
- **Slip**: A lapse in attention or execution despite knowing the correct procedure.  
- **Mistake**: A wrong decision based on faulty judgment or incomplete information.  
- **Violation**: Deliberate deviation from established procedures or rules.  

## Error Chains
- Most accidents result from a sequence of small errors, not a single catastrophic mistake.  
- Recognize weak links in planning, preparation, or execution to prevent escalation.  

## Key Takeaways
Anticipating human error allows divers to implement redundancies and safeguards.
