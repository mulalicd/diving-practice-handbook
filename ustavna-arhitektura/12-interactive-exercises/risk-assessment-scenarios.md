markdown# Risk Assessment Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Changing Conditions

### Initial Plan
- Location: Local quarry, familiar site
- Depth: 25m
- Team: You + experienced buddy
- Conditions forecast: Calm, 5m visibility
- Equipment: Standard recreational setup

### What Changed
You arrive to find:
- Visibility reduced to 2m (heavy rain overnight)
- Water temperature 5°C colder than expected
- Your buddy mentions feeling "slightly under the weather"
- Strong surface wind creating chop

### Your Task
1. Use risk matrix to assess each factor
2. Apply Go/No-Go criteria from Chapter 10
3. Make and justify your decision
4. Propose modifications if needed

### Risk Matrix Template
| Factor | Probability | Severity | Risk Level |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Low visibility | High | Medium | ? |
| Cold water | High | Medium | ? |
| Buddy health | Medium | High | ? |
| Surface conditions | High | Low | ? |

### Decision Framework
[Space for user decision and reasoning]

### Expert Analysis
[Detailed breakdown of considerations]
[Multiple valid approaches discussed]
[Safety priorities highlighted]

### Learning Points
- How conditions interact (cold + low vis = higher risk)
- Why buddy health is non-negotiable
- When to modify vs. cancel
- Communication with buddy about concerns
