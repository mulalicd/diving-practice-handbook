## Exercise 1: Single Dive Planning

### Scenario
First dive of the day to 18 meters for 35 minutes.

### Question 1: What is your ending pressure group?
[Space for user answer]

### Question 2: What is the maximum NDL for this depth?
[Space for user answer]

### Solution
Step 1: Find 18m depth row in table
Step 2: Locate 35 minutes bottom time
Step 3: Read pressure group = F
Maximum NDL at 18m = 56 minutes
Safety margin = 21 minutes remaining

### Why This Matters
Understanding pressure groups is essential for planning repetitive dives safely.

## Exercise 2: Repetitive Dive Planning

### Scenario
Dive 1: 20m for 30 minutes → Ending group: E
Surface interval: 1 hour 15 minutes
Dive 2: 15m - how long can you stay?
