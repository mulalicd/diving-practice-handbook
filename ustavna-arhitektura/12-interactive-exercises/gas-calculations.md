## Section 1: PPO2 Calculations

### Exercise 1.1: Basic PPO2
You're diving with EAN32 (32% O2) to 25 meters.
Calculate the PPO2.

**Formula**: PPO2 = FO2 × (Depth/10 + 1)

**Your Calculation**:
[Workspace]

**Solution**:
FO2 = 0.32
Ambient pressure at 25m = 25/10 + 1 = 3.5 bar
PPO2 = 0.32 × 3.5 = 1.12 bar

**Is this safe?**
Yes, within recreational limit of 1.4 bar for working depth.
Safety margin = 0.28 bar

### Exercise 1.2: Maximum Operating Depth
You have EAN36. What is the maximum depth for PPO2 = 1.4?

**Your Calculation**:
[Workspace]

**Solution**:
1.4 = 0.36 × (Depth/10 + 1)
Depth/10 + 1 = 1.4/0.36 = 3.89
Depth/10 = 2.89
Depth = 28.9m ≈ 29m maximum
